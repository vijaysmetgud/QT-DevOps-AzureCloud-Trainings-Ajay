Networking for Cloud Computing
------------------------------

### Concepts required
* IPv4 ip addressing
* subnetting
* Routing
* NAT
* Gateways
* DNS
* Virtual Private Networks (VPN)
* WAN (Wide Area Networks)

### Networking Basics
* A device/system connects to the network with the help of network interface.
* Network interface gets an ip address which is allocated by DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
* In our home networks, the DHCP server is inside your router
* DHCP maintains list of available ip addresses and the whole range of network
* Range of network is ip address range
![Preview](./Images/network.png)
* open the command prompt or powershell
  
  `ipconfig`
![Preview](./Images/network1.png)
* The details include in below screen shot
   * IP Address
   * Subnet Mast
   * Default Gateway
   ![Preview](./Images/network2.png)

### Ip Address

* Ip Address = Network Id/Address + Device/Host Id/Address

  `192.168.0.198`
* subnet mask helps in separating network id and host id
* ip v4 is an ip address which is 32 bit and represented in 4 octets
 
   `X.X.X.X`

* Each position is 8 bits which is called as octet
* [Refer Here](https://www.mymathtables.com/numbers/power-exponentiation/power-of-2.html) for 2 power table
* range of total ip v4 addresses

  `0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255`
* Subnet mask is used to findout network id and host id
```
     1   2  3 4
ip: 192.168.0.10
sm: 255.255.255.0

octects with 255 => 1.2.3

network id: 192.168
host id: 10


ip: 10.10.0.17
sm: 255.255.0.0

network id: 10.10
host id: 0.17

ip: 101.245.1.7
sm: 255.0.0.0

nid: 101
host: 245.1.7
```
  * Two devices can communicate directly if the network id’s match
  * For connecting to device which is not part of your network then how ?
     * Router is a device in networking which can forward packet from one network to other network
  * When we try to connect to external devices router will have rules defined to forward packets.

* Example to see how networks travels

### Size of network
   * number of devices that can be connected to the network i.e. number of hosts/devices that can be connected in a network

```
ip: 192.168.100.111
sm: 255.255.255.0

nid: 192.168.100
hid: 111

with in a network
nid = fixed = 3 octets
hid = variable = 1 octet = 8 bits => 2^8 hosts => 256
nid = 192.168.100.0
broadcast = 192.168.100.255
i.e
size of network => 2^ (host id bits) - 2
                => 2^8 -2
                => 254


ip: 10.100.102.32 
sm: 255.255.0.0
nid = 2 octets
hid = 2 octets = 16 bits
size => 2^16 - 2
     => 65536 - 2
     => 65534

```

   * In every network we can use two ip addresses
      * 0: this represents network id
      * 255: this represents broadcast address

   * To create networks of different sizes, we have two approaches
      * Classful networking
      ![Preview](./Images/network4.png)
      * Classless interdomain routing (CIDR)
      
   * CIDR Approach  
```
ip: 192.168.100.111
sm: 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000

nid => number of consecutive 1's = 24 (fixed)
hid => 8 (number of consecutive 0's)

for= 2^ (hid bits) - 2
   = 2^8 -2 = 254

ip: 192.168.100.111
sm: 11111111.11111111.11111110.00000000

size = 2^9 - 2 = 512 - 2 = 510
```
   
   * I have 2000 devices what should be by subnet mask

### Observations:
* network id's all = 0's
* broadcast id's all = 1's or 255
* Capital N = all 1's 
* Small N = total number of network id bits 

* Expand CIDR
```

```
* What is bigger network in this
   * A: 172.16.0.0/15 => 2 ^ (32-15) – 2 => 2^ 17
   * B: 192.168.0.0/17 => 2 ^ (32-17) – 2 => 2^15

### Subnetting

  * Subnet is smaller network.
  * Subnetting is an activity of creating smaller networks from large network

### Scenario – 1

NAT Gateway
-----------
* Network Address Translation is required to provide internet access to private networks
* Nat will transfer our request from router with public ip and takes request from destination and again forward request to router with our home private ip 
![Preview](./Images/network11.png)

DNS
----
* Domain Naming Server/Domain Name System: The major responsibility of DNS Servers are to maintain records of Domains
* DNS Servers maintains records
   * Name to IP
   * Name to Name
* DNS Record Types: [Refer Here](https://www.site24x7.com/learn/dns-record-types.html)

Azure Virtual Networks (Vnet)
-----------------------------
* [Refer Here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview) for official docs
* Azure virtual networks is a service offered by Microsoft Azure to manage networks
* Azure Virtual Network is a private network.
* If we need to connect any resources to the network, we need to have subnet.
* In the case of virtual machine, subnets and vm are connected via network interface (nic). This nic gets a private ip address from subnet range
![Preview](./Images/network14.png)
* By default azure vnets will have internet connectivity
* If your network interface (vm) needs to be accesed directly from internet, we can create a public ip and attach to the nic,below screen shot.
![Preview](./Images/network15.png)
* in azure subnets can belong to two zones, means we can create vm of same subnets in the different zone
* in aws and gcp subnets belongs to zones not a region so same subnets can be created in only one zones not in multiple zones
* refer below screen shots for azure subnets in zones
![Preview](./Images/network16.png)

### Creating a VM and Impact of network, subnet and public ip
* In Azure there are no default networks, you can use what is present in your account or create a new network
* Examples below
![Preview](./Images/network17.png)

### Terms
  * Latency
    * [Refer here](https://www.azurespeed.com/Azure/Latency) to check azure latency
    ![Preview](./Images/network13.png) 

### Lets create a virtual network in a region
* name: ntier
* cidr range is known as (address space): 192.168.0.0/22
* We will be having 4 subnets
   * web: 192.168.0.0/24
   * app: 192.168.1.0/24
   * db: 192.168.2.0/24
   * mgmt: 192.168.3.0/24
* [Refer Here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/quick-create-portal) for Azure portal to create a virtual network
* **Steps:**
![Preview](./Images/network18.png)
![Preview](./Images/network19.png)
![Preview](./Images/network20.png)
![Preview](./Images/network21.png)
![Preview](./Images/network22.png)
![Preview](./Images/network23.png)
![Preview](./Images/network24.png)
* Like below screen shot we have created the network with subnets
![Preview](./Images/network25.png)
* When we try to create a vm in one of the subnets a nic is created. There will generally be Network Security Group attached to nic.
![Preview](./Images/network26.png)
* If we need to access publically, then the nic will be associated with public ip address
![Preview](./Images/network27.png)
* Lets create vm in above network with web subnet by giving public ip address
![Preview](./Images/network28.png)
![Preview](./Images/network29.png)
![Preview](./Images/network30.png)
![Preview](./Images/network31.png)
![Preview](./Images/network32.png)
* check random public ip created but subnet has assigned the private ip for this vm for nic below screen shot
![Preview](./Images/network33.png)
* Now Lets login into vm and cross check vm get internet or not and also we are able to login or not since we have opened port `22` and `80`
![Preview](./Images/network34.png)
* we are able to login and vm is getting internet above screen shot proof.
* If i try to connect the vm which is created from my laptop with below command, its not connecting it, because we have opened port only `22` and `80` so apart from this two port others port will deny
![Preview](./Images/network35.png)
* Now lets create one more vm with same network into app subnet but lets not give public ip.
![Preview](./Images/network36.png)
![Preview](./Images/network37.png)
![Preview](./Images/network38.png)
![Preview](./Images/network39.png)
![Preview](./Images/network40.png)
* Now observe below screen shot this vm has not created public ip, only got private ip 
![Preview](./Images/network41.png)
*  In Azure vnets by default all internal communication is allowed by nsg
![Preview](./Images/network42.png)
* Now with in the same network two vm's can communicate each, it is possible, by vm which has public ip from that vm we can connect to other vm which is not having public ip this process is called `jump box/host` or `bastion host`
* From webvm i am able to connect to appvm below screen shot
![Preview](./Images/network43.png)

* In Azure when we create subnet the size of subnet is 2^n-5 [Refer Here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-faq#are-there-any-restrictions-on-using-ip-addresses-within-these-subnets)

* [Refer Here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-faq) for Azure Vnet faq


Network Security Groups (NSG)
-----------------------------
* NSG’s can be attached to Network Interface and also to subnets
* NSG’s have two types rules
   * incoming/inbound (ingress)
   * outgoing/outbound (egress)
* Rules have a number which defines priority. Lower the number higher the priority
* NSG’s have default rules
  * Lets create NSG and check default rules
  ![Preview](./Images/network44.png)
  ![Preview](./Images/network45.png)
  ![Preview](./Images/network46.png)
  ![Preview](./Images/network47.png)
* NSG Each rule will have:
   * Priority:
   * Port: port no
   * Protocol:
       * TCP
       * UDP
       * ICMP
   * Source:
   ![Preview](./Images/network48.png)
   * Destination: Will have similar options as Source
   * Action: Allow or Deny
* IpAddress in source of destination we will be giving CIDR Ranges. This works on the basis of network id
   * specific network: 10.10.0.0/16
   * specific ip address: 100.100.100.100/32
   * Any ip address: 0.0.0.0/0
* Best Practices:
   * Start NSG Rules from priority numbers such as 300 (but not 100)
   * Between rules should have some numbers left

### Scenario 1: Create NSG For the below
* Overview
![Preview](./Images/network49.png)
* Web NSG:
![Preview](./Images/network50.png)
![Preview](./Images/network51.png)
![Preview](./Images/network52.png)
* App NSG:
  * it should allow only internal communication with in vnet & no connectivity from internet. That is what we get as default rules in NSG
![Preview](./Images/network53.png)
![Preview](./Images/network54.png)
* DB nsg: 
   * deny incoming from web subnet

### Scenario 2: Create NSG For the the below
* Overview
![Preview](./Images/network49.png)
* Web server runs on port 443 (TCP)
* app server runs on port 5000 (TCP)
* db server run on port 3306 (TCP)
* Allow 22 port communication from any ip with in network for web,app,db servers.

### Scenario 2: 
![Preview](./Images/network49.png)
* Create a vnet with name ntier with cidr range of `10.10.0.0/22`
* Create 4 subnets
   * web: 10.10.0.0/24
   * app: 10.10.1.0/24
   * db: 10.10.2.0/24
   * mgmt: 10.10.3.0/24

   * DBnsg:
   ![Preview](./Images/network66.png)
   ![Preview](./Images/network67.png)
* Create a linux vm in web subnet with public ip
![Preview](./Images/network68.png)
![Preview](./Images/network69.png)
![Preview](./Images/network70.png)
![Preview](./Images/network71.png)
![Preview](./Images/network72.png)
* Create a linux vm in app subnet with public ip, even if we create public ip it is not useful because we have not open all the ports in security groups it will block and make as private, so jus for fun we are creating public ip. 
![Preview](./Images/network73.png)
![Preview](./Images/network74.png)
![Preview](./Images/network75.png)
![Preview](./Images/network76.png)
![Preview](./Images/network77.png)
* Create a linux vm in db subnet with public ip, even if we create public ip it is not useful because we have not open all the ports in security groups it will block and make as private, so jus for fun we are creating public ip.
![Preview](./Images/network78.png)
![Preview](./Images/network79.png)
![Preview](./Images/network80.png)
![Preview](./Images/network81.png)
* Login into webvm and cross check connections

   `ssh username@ip`
   * we are able to login since ssh port 22 is open in webnsg
   ![Preview](./Images/network82.png)
   * ping is working from webvm and also i can ping from my laptop local windows terminal to webvm it is working since we have open ping port from nay where
   ![Preview](./Images/network83.png)
   ![Preview](./Images/network84.png)
   * ping will work from webvm to appvm
   ![Preview](./Images/network88.png)
* Login into appvm cross check the connections, if i ssh into it (it will not be allowed directly)
![Preview](./Images/network85.png)
* why it is unable ssh into appvm is we have not opened any port apart from default nsg so.
* only one way to connect appvm is from webvm because we have opened AllowVnetInBound within the network and also we need use private ip to connect from webvm to appvm.
![Preview](./Images/network86.png)

    `ssh dell@10.10.1.4`
* Now let me ping webvm, i am able to ping below screen shot proves it.
![Preview](./Images/network87.png) 
* from appvm i am able to connect to internet
![Preview](./Images/network94.png)   
* Login into dbvm and cross check the connections
![Preview](./Images/network89.png)
* unable to ssh into dbvm because we have not opened any port apart from default above screen shot proves it.
* Let me try to ping from webvm to dbvm 
![Preview](./Images/network90.png)
* unable to ping because we have wrote in nsg rule as deny access from webvm, above screen shot proves it.
* even cannot ssh from webvm to dbvm below screen shot proves it.
![Preview](./Images/network91.png)
* so to connect dbvm only way is according our artitecture of overview, is connect to webvm and from webvm connect appvm and from appvm connect to dbvm. below screen shot will proves it.
![Preview](./Images/network92.png)
* from dbvm i am able to connect internet 
![Preview](./Images/network93.png)
* So now really we dont need public for dbvm and appvm which is we created, it is no sense of having public ip as above test case
  * So we will remove public ip from dbvm and appvm
  ![Preview](./Images/network95.png)
  ![Preview](./Images/network96.png)
  ![Preview](./Images/network97.png)
  ![Preview](./Images/network98.png)
* So now when after removing the public ip from appvm and dbvm it is unable to get internet access because when public ip is associate to any vm they will get internet access.  
![Preview](./Images/network99.png)
![Preview](./Images/network100.png)

* **Testing network security groups:**
  * Testing can be done by creating NSG with vms and testing
  * The other effective way to check NSG with VM's is Network watcher => NSG Diagnostics
  * example we are checking now from my local ip can i connect to vm which created in azure appvm.?
  ![Preview](./Images/network101.png)
  * below is the result 
  ![Preview](./Images/network102.png)
  
  * **packet capture:**
    * with the help of packet capture we can monitor the vm's behavior or all the packets which is comes in and out and can watch the logs.

    ![Preview](./Images/network107.png)

### Application Security Groups
* ASG is a just an labelling for nsg or vm's
* ASG can filter network traffic according to asg attached to nic’s irrespective of which subnet they belong
* if we want to restrict any NSG rule, not required to work on ip address rather we use ASG this is the benefit.
* [Refer Here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/application-security-groups) for Application security groups
* Lets create ASG for webASG and appASG
![Preview](./Images/network108.png)
![Preview](./Images/network109.png)
![Preview](./Images/network110.png)
* Lets create a vm with NSG rule for webvm

![Preview](./Images/network119.png)
![Preview](./Images/network120.png)
![Preview](./Images/network121.png)
* Now attach APP application security groups to appvm
![Preview](./Images/network122.png)
![Preview](./Images/network123.png)
![Preview](./Images/network124.png)
* Now Now attach web application security groups to webvm
![Preview](./Images/network125.png)
![Preview](./Images/network126.png)
* Now login into webvm and ping to appvm, able to ping
![Preview](./Images/network127.png)
* Now from webvm ssh to appvm , able to login
![Preview](./Images/network128.png)
* Now do some changes in APPNSG to see result as we expect, here i am expecting two result
  * from webvm should able to ping appvm
  ![Preview](./Images/network129.png)
  ![Preview](./Images/network130.png)
  ![Preview](./Images/network131.png)
  * its done result is success webvm is able to ping appvm above screen shot proves it.
  * from webvm should not ssh to appvm
  ![Preview](./Images/network132.png)
  ![Preview](./Images/network133.png)
  ![Preview](./Images/network134.png)
  * above screen shot proves from webvm to appvm it is unable to ssh

### Routing in Azure vnet
* Azure routes means sending a traffic between all subnets within a virtual network
* In every Azure VNet we have a router with system default routes defined [Refer Here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-udr-overview)
* In Azure Routing we have
     * System routes
     * user defined routing(Custom routes)

### Azure NAT(Network Address Translation) Gateway
* NAT Gateway means to get internet connection for our private resources
* [Refer Here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/nat-gateway/nat-overview)
* **Experiment:**
* **Steps:**
  * create virutal network `ntier` with 3 subnets `web`,`app` and `db`
  ![Preview](./Images/network135.png)
  ![Preview](./Images/network136.png)
  ![Preview](./Images/network137.png)

  ![Preview](./Images/network153.png)
* when i tried to test it, appvm without public ip but we have attached nat gateway even though it is not getting the internet connection, also sir was very angry he dint tell about it.. so this is pending task....                                       

### Vnet Peering:
#### Azure Inter-Network private connectivity
* Establishing connectivity between vnets in Azure
* Rules:
   * CIDR Ranges should not collide
* Options:
  * VNET TO VNET [Refer Here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-howto-vnet-vnet-cli#vnet-to-vnet)
  * VNET Peering [Refer Here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-peering-overview) 

* Peering overview:
![Preview](./Images/network154.png)
* Peering connection is between two networks, but one network can create multiple peering connections with different networks
* Peering connections are not transitive i.e. A is Peered to B and B is Peered to C that does not mean A is peered to C
* **Experiment:**
* We have create two vnets and vms as shown in the below image
![Preview](./Images/network155.png)
* **Steps:**
* Lets create vnet A with subnet web,region east us
![Preview](./Images/network156.png)
![Preview](./Images/network157.png)
* now create webvm in vnet A with subnet web and open ssh port, region east us
![Preview](./Images/network158.png)
![Preview](./Images/network159.png)
*  Lets create vnet B with subnet app, region central us
![Preview](./Images/network160.png)
![Preview](./Images/network161.png)
* Now create appvm in vnet B with subnet app and open ping port , region central us
![Preview](./Images/network162.png)
![Preview](./Images/network163.png)
* Now lets create a Vnet peering connection for Vnet A to Vnet B
![Preview](./Images/network164.png)
![Preview](./Images/network165.png)
![Preview](./Images/network166.png)
![Preview](./Images/network167.png)
![Preview](./Images/network168.png)
* Now try connect from vnet A wevm to vnet B appvm via ping action 
![Preview](./Images/network169.png)
* it is connecting and able to ping from webvm to appvm in different vnet with different region
* Even ssh from webvm to appvm is possible below screen shot proves it.
![Preview](./Images/network170.png)

### Virtual Private Networks (VPN)
* Virtual Private Networks allow private network connectivity between two networks.
* what is the difference between peering is vpn will connect any two network like on premise/organizational and virtual
* VPN works with any two networks satisfying minimal criteria
   * ip’s should not collide
   * There is some infra to connect two networks, so that infra could be (Physical cables/internet connectivity/virtual connectivity) 
* VPN are of two types:
   * Point to Site Connection
     * point to site connection means below image, like we connecting our laptop from home to our organization network
   ![Preview](./Images/network171.png)
   * Site to Site Connection
     * site to site connection means below image, like connection two different branches of same organization networks
   ![Preview](./Images/network172.png)

#### What is VPN
* VPN enables private connectivity between networks or a device to a network
* VPNs are of two types
   * Point to Site (Private connection between device and a network)
   * Site to Site (private Connection between two networks)
* Site to Site:
![Preview](./Images/network173.png)
* Mutli site:
![Preview](./Images/network174.png)
* Hub Spoke model azure:
![Preview](./Images/network175.png)
* Virtual WAN:
![Preview](./Images/network176.png)


Azure Site to Site VPN
----------------------
* [Refer Here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/tutorial-site-to-site-portal)
* overview
![Preview](./Images/network177.png)
* We need a virtual network and with VPN gateway in Azure
* We also need a onprem network with vpn. Supported vendors for vpn [Refer Here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpn-devices)
* What we want to acheive
![Preview](./Images/network178.png)
* **Experiment:**
* **Steps:**
#### In Azure Cloud
* Create a vnet in Azure with cidr range of `10.250.0.0/16` and subnet for web and app.
![Preview](./Images/network179.png)
![Preview](./Images/network180.png)
* We need to create a vpn gateway and Gateways will be part of Gateway subnet
![Preview](./Images/network181.png)
![Preview](./Images/network182.png)
* Lets create Virtual network gateways [Refer Here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/tutorial-site-to-site-portal#create-the-gateway)
![Preview](./Images/network193.png)
![Preview](./Images/network194.png)
![Preview](./Images/network195.png)
![Preview](./Images/network196.png)
![Preview](./Images/network197.png)
* Lets create Local network gateways
![Preview](./Images/network205.png)
![Preview](./Images/network206.png)
![Preview](./Images/network207.png)
![Preview](./Images/network208.png)
![Preview](./Images/network209.png)

#### In AWS Cloud
* Now lets simulate the on-prem vpn. in this case we are simulating on-prem in AWS
  * because we dint have the our organization on-prem network 
* Lets create vpc with subnets
![Preview](./Images/network183.png)
![Preview](./Images/network184.png)
![Preview](./Images/network185.png)
![Preview](./Images/network186.png)
![Preview](./Images/network187.png)
![Preview](./Images/network188.png)
* Create Virtual private gateways(VPN) and attach to above created vpc
![Preview](./Images/network189.png)
![Preview](./Images/network190.png)
![Preview](./Images/network191.png)
![Preview](./Images/network192.png)
* Lets create Customer gateways
  * customer gateways is azure vpn 
  * mention ip address tab of azure virtual network gateways Public IP address.
![Preview](./Images/network198.png)
![Preview](./Images/network199.png)
![Preview](./Images/network200.png)
* Lets created Site-to-Site VPN connections
![Preview](./Images/network201.png)
![Preview](./Images/network202.png)
![Preview](./Images/network203.png)
![Preview](./Images/network204.png)
* once the state shows available then download the configuration file in that shared key to connect azure to aws vpn and public ip address of vpn server, all the vpn details are available.

#### Finally if we do this configuration then site to site vpn will work properly
* this is the final step
* go to Virtual network gatways in azure
![Preview](./Images/network210.png)
![Preview](./Images/network211.png)
![Preview](./Images/network212.png)
* but in this experiement things will not work properly because azure list supported vendor for vpn is not there since we have did trial in aws clous for on-prem network with aws vpn, it is kind of stimulation.


Virtual WAN
-------------

>>if we want to create two or three peering and multiple branches of organization networks and also azure networks together, then it is better option to go with virtual wan since all networks connection we connect to virtual wan through which we connect each other networks. and also even we can connect point to site vpn to means even our laptop connection to network also we can connect to virtual wan.
>>
* [Refer Here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-wan/virtual-wan-about) for virtual wan official docs
![Preview](https://i0.wp.com/learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-wan/media/virtual-wan-about/virtual-wan-diagram.png?w=800&ssl=1)

* Alternative to WAN

Express Route
-------------
* [Refer Here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-introduction) for express route
![Preview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/media/expressroute-introduction/expressroute-connection-overview.png)


Distributing Traffic
---------------------

### Problem with load/stress on the application
* Generally web servers when accessed create a load on cpu and memory for every request. As number of request increase one server will not be able to solve the problem/execute the request. On a broader note we have two options
   * Horizontal scaling: Increase number of servers running the application
   * Vertical Scaling: Increase the server resources such as CPU/Memory etc.
   ![Preview](./Images/network213.png)
* If the number of servers are many then we cant share all the vms ips to requester. To solve this we need to understand the concept of Proxy Servers   

#### Proxy Server
* proxy server means to block any request or if companies says that we cannot use social media so if someone from the organization wants to access any urls which is not allowed then this proxy server will filter the request and block it. we can write rules on this proxy server allow or deny.
* proxy server is used for client for outgoing connection or requests
* proxy server is responsiblity for blocking url or request
* proxy is about outgoing request
* proxy server is responsible for filtering the network traffic
![Preview](./Images/network214.png)

#### Reverse Proxy Server
* reverse proxy server is about incoming request.
* for an example if users use browser based application or mobile app based application if they want to access our application, they will request through internet and internet will forward the request to public ip server and this server will forward the request to server which our application is running so this is known as incoming request.
* reverse proxy is responsible for forwarding incoming client request
* reverse proxy is responsible for distributing incoming traffic
![Preview](./Images/network215.png)

#### Forward Proxy Server
* [Refer Here](https://iamabhishek-dubey.medium.com/forward-proxy-and-reverse-proxy-128e05e9e43a)
* [Refer Here](https://www.indusface.com/blog/what-is-reverse-proxy/)


### Load Balancers
* Load Balancers serve incoming traffic to a application and distribute it across servers
* Load Balancers major functionality is around
   * Distributing an application traffic so that the individual servers do not become overloaded
![Preview](./Images/network216.png)
* Types of Load Balancers (functionality)
   * Layer 4 load balancer
   * Layer 7 load balancer
* Type of Load Balancers (creation)
   * Hardware load balancer
   * Software load balancer
   * Virtual load balancer

### OSI Networking Model
* Model overview
![Preview](./Images/network217.png)
![Preview](./Images/network218.png)
* Each layer adds functionality
![Preview](./Images/network219.png)
![Preview](./Images/network220.png)
* Now layer 4 loadbalancing can make load balancing decisions on the basis of
   * ip address
   * port
   * protocol (TCP/UDP)
* Layer 7 has knowledge of http in addition to layer 4

### Layer 4 scenario in Cloud
* In cloud generally we have two types of load balancing
   * internal load balancing
   * internet facing/public load balancing
![Preview](./Images/network221.png)
* Terms: in configurations
  * inbound: where the users will hit the load balancer
  * outbound: where the load balancer needs to send the traffic
* Azure Layer 4 Load Balancer
![Preview](./Images/network222.png)

* AWS Layer 4 Load Balancer
![Preview](./Images/network223.png)

* Mapping name to public address of Load Balancer is done in DNS zone
![Preview](./Images/network224.png)

### Load Balancing Algorithms

### DMZ (De-militarized Zone)
![Previw](./Images/network225.png)

### Lab setup for Load Balancing
* **Steps:**
* Create a ubuntu vm/ec2 instance with 80 port and 22 port opened
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apache2 -y
sudo apt install stress -y
```
* Create a file in `/var/www/html/index.html` with following content
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body style="background-color:powderblue;">
<h1>Welcome to Load Balancing</h1>
<p>This is for learning</p>
</body>
</html>
```
* Now access `http://<public ip>`
* shutdown this instance

Azure load Balancers
---------------------
* Azure has two types of load balancers
   * Azure Load Balancer (Layer 4)
   * Azure Application Gateway (Layer 7)

* Now access the loadbalancer frontend public ip, so that we can access our application which is running vm.
![Preview](./Images/network253.png)
* Lets view vm, observe here very carefully, vm doesn't have public ip, so azure has assigned loadbalancer public ip to vm below screen shot proves it.
![Preview](./Images/network254.png)


Azure Application Gateway
-------------------------
* This is layer 7 load balancer offered by Azure
* [Refer Here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/overview) for official docs
