
Helm In Kubernetes:
--------------------
* [Refer Here](https://helm.sh/docs/) for official docs
* [Refer Here](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) helm installation
* [Refer Here](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/cheatsheet/) for helm Cheat Sheet and [Refer Here](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm/) Helm commands in detail
* [Refer Here](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/) details of helm charts all the files
* Helm is a package manager in kubernetes
* by creating helm charts we get all manifest/yml files by pre-defined, so that we dont have to create each and every manifest/yml files for each resources
* also with single command we can deploy our object/resources to kubernetes cluster
* Helm calls each package as chart.
* Helm uses a packaging format called charts. A chart is a collection of files that describe a related set of Kubernetes resources.

  `helm install my-charts`
values.yml files is variable for templates in manifest files
* Manifests/yml files are static in nature, to add reusability and dynamic nature to manifests/yml we use helm
* helm charts we convert into package like archive
* helm charts has a repository, so that even our own repo we can store it in the repository and later we can pull using helm command and use it. 
*  the Artifact Hub is the popular helm charts repository. Once you have Helm chart ready, you can add a chart to repository. Check Artifact Hub for available Helm chart repositories.
  * [Refer Here](https://artifacthub.io/packages/search?kind=0) Artifact Hub



#### Helm Artitecture:
![Preview](./Images/helm1.png)

* When we create helm chart with below command

`helm create  my-charts`

`helm create <chart_name>`

* the directories and files which will be created below.
![Preview](./Images/helm2.png)

* Below explains about directories and files structure
  * For example, 'helm create foo' will create a directory structure that looks something like this:

```
├── .helmignore  # Contains patterns/files to ignore when packaging Helm charts/when building packages.
├── Chart.yaml    # Information/description about your chart like version, name etc:
├── values.yaml   # The default values for your templates, alos it is variable for your template manifest files
├── charts/       # Charts that this chart depends on/ consists of dependencies for our chart 
└── templates/    # The template files/manifest files
    └── tests/    # The test files    
```
* Some more explaination about directories and files for above structure:
  * The `templates/` directory is for template files. When Helm evaluates a chart, it will send all of the files in the `templates/` directory through the template rendering engine. It then collects the results of those templates and sends them on to Kubernetes.
  * The `values.yaml` file is also important to templates. This file contains the default values for a chart. These values may be overridden by users during `helm install` or `helm upgrade.`
  * The `Chart.yaml` file contains a description of the chart. You can access it from within a template.
  * The `charts/` directory may contain other charts (which we call subcharts). Later in this guide we will see how those work when it comes to template rendering.
* If you take a look at the `mychart/templates/` directory, you'll notice a few files there.  
  * `NOTES.txt:` The "help text" for your chart. This will be displayed to your users when they run `helm install.`
  * `deployment.yaml:` A basic manifest for creating a Kubernetes deployment
  * `service.yaml:` A basic manifest for creating a service endpoint for your `deployment`
  * `_helpers.tpl:` A place to put template helpers that you can re-use throughout the chart

### Helm Templates Developing Method:
* Helm uses Go text template engine
* `{{ }}` these are referred as actions. Anything outside these actions is copied to output
* Inside actions there are variety of features 
  * including
  * ipelines
  * if/else statements
  * loops
  * variables
  * functions etc: 

### Helm chart components at a high level:
Create a helm chart `helm create hello-world`
![Preview](./Images/helm3.png)
* [Refer Here](https://github.com/AjayKumarRamesh/QT-DevOps-AzureCloud-Trainings-Ajay/tree/master/Kubernetes/Helm) for chart directories and files structures 

### Example Demonstration:1 AWS
* Create a helm chart

 `helm create my-chart`

* After creating helm chart the files looks like below
![Preview](./Images/helm4.png)

* So now we want to convert helm chart into normal manifest file which every one can understand it.
```
helm template --help
helm template [NAME] [CHART] [flags]
```
* So execute below commands to covert helm chart into normal file called check

`helm template attempt1 .\my-chart\ --output-dir .\check`
* after we execute above command files looks like below which is normal 
![Preview](./Images/helm5.png)
* Now if we change the values.yml file of each resources mentioned in the values.yml, while created at time of my-chart, when value.yml file is generated. what will happen is we can see the changes takes place in normal converted file too, so this demonstration is just for our understanding. 

* Now after changning some values in the value.yml file run the same below command so that we can see the observation of values change in the normal manifest files 
* before change 

![Preview](./Images/helm6.png)
* after execute command and change it values

``helm template attempt1 .\my-chart\ --output-dir .\check`

![Preview](./Images/helm7.png)

#### Refer below manifest file for demonstration
 * [Refer Here](https://github.com/AjayKumarRamesh/QT-DevOps-AzureCloud-Trainings-Ajay/tree/master/Kubernetes/Helm/Helm_Chart_Examples/my-chart) 

 * execute below commands:
```
helm install myfirst-test my-chart/
helm list
kubectl get deploy
kubectl get pods
kubectl get svc
helm uninstall myfirst-test
```
![Preview](./Images/helm8.png)
![Preview](./Images/helm9.png)

* Now access the applications:
`lb:portno`

### Example Demonstration:2 AWS

* Create helm chart

`helm chart helloworld`

* install/deploy helm chart into k8s cluster

` helm install myhelloworld-release hello-world`

* output is below
```
NAME: myhelloworld-release
LAST DEPLOYED: Wed Oct 11 00:44:22 2023
NAMESPACE: default
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
NOTES:
1. Get the application URL by running these commands:
  export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace default -l "app.kubernetes.io/name=hello-world,app.kubernetes.io/instance=myhelloworld-release" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
  export CONTAINER_PORT=$(kubectl get pod --namespace default $POD_NAME -o jsonpath="{.spec.containers[0].ports[0].containerPort}")
  echo "Visit http://127.0.0.1:8080 to use your application"
  kubectl --namespace default port-forward $POD_NAME 8080:$CONTAINER_PORT
```
* List the service which is running
 
  `helm list`
* Output is below
```
NAME                    NAMESPACE       REVISION        UPDATED                                 STATUS          CHART                   APP VERSION
myhelloworld-release    default         1               2023-10-11 00:44:22.8316678 +0530 IST   deployed        hello-world-0.1.0       1.16.0
```
* To get service 

`kubectl get service/svc`
* Access the applications

`http://ip-address:portno`

* If we do any changes to our helm chart means if changes the values.yml or any files templates resources file then we needs to run upgrade command
* before changes screenshot

```
vi hello-world
cd hello-world/
vi values.yaml
```
![Preview](./Images/helm11.png)
* Before change below screen shot
`helm list`
![Preview](./Images/helm13.png)
* After changes below screen shot
![Preview](./Images/helm12.png)
* Execute below command

 `helm upgrade myhelloworld-release hello-world`
![Preview](./Images/helm14.png)
* To check upgrade done or not

 `helm list`
 ![Preview](./Images/helm15.png)
* Now we are rolling back to previous version of helm 
` helm rollback myhelloworld-release 1`
![Preview](./Images/helm16.png)
* To debug and dry run the helm chart to check any errors or issues arise before we deploy

` helm install helloworld-release --debug --dry-run hello-world`
* It gives full manifest files output

#### sample helm template for nopCommerce with changes in dynamic values:
* [Refer Here](https://github.com/AjayKumarRamesh/QT-DevOps-AzureCloud-Trainings-Ajay/tree/master/Kubernetes/Helm/Helm_Chart_Examples/nopcommerce) for manifest of dynamic values changed

## HelmFile:
* helmfile is to manage the helm charts in single command 
* [Refer Here](https://helmfile.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for kind of official docs
* [Refer Here](https://jhooq.com/helmfile-manage-helmchart/) basic steps to know helmfile

#### Installing helmfile in windows:

```
choco install kubernetes-helmfile
helmfile version
```

### Example demonstration aws eks

* Steps:
```
# create helm chart
helm create helloworld
# create helm file
vi helmfile.yml
# copy below content into helmfile.yml file
---
releases:
- name: myhellorelease
  chart: ./helloworld
  installed: true
# save the file
# Now execute the helmfile
helmfile sync
# to check service is running 
helm list
```
* Output Below screen shot:
![Preview](./Images/helm18.png)
![Preview](./Images/helm19.png)

* To uninstall the release/chart which we deployed

```
# change installed value to false
---
releases:
- name: myhellorelease
  chart: ./helloworld
  installed: false
# execute below command
helmfile sync
helm list  
```
![Preview](./Images/helm20.png)
![Preview](./Images/helm21.png)

* Another way of install helmfile:

`helmfile --help`

```
# install plugins
helm init
helmfile apply
helm list
```
* Another way to uninstall helfile:

```
helmfile delete
helmfile list
```

#### Deploying helm chart from github repository to k8s cluster:

* **Steps:**

```
git clone git@github.com:codesquareZone/helmchart.git
helm create helloworld
vi helmfile.yaml 
# put the content below into helmfile.yaml
---
repositories:
- name: helmchart
  url: https://github.com/codesquareZone/helmchart/tree/master/helloworld
releases:
- name: mynewrelease:1.0
  chart: helloworld
  installed: true 
# git push 
git push origin master  
# execute below command
helmfile sync
helm list  
```

#### Helm Hooks:
* helm hooks means same like k8s jobs or cronjobs
so to scheduler or run some jobs before our applications gets deployed in the k8s cluster, same way we will use helm hooks before deploy charts into kubernetes cluster.
* [Refer Here](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts_hooks/) for helm hooks
